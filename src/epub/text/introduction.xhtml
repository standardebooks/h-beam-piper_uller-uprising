					<p>The planet is named Uller (it seems that when interstellar travel was developed, the names of Greek Gods had been used up, so those of Norse gods were used). It is the second planet of the star Beta Hydri, right angle 0:23, declension −77:32, G0 (solar) type star, of approximately the same size as Sol; distance from Earth, 21 light years.</p>
					<p>Uller revolves around it in a nearly circular orbit, at a distance of 100,000,000 miles, making it a little colder than Earth. A year is of the approximate length of that on Earth. A day lasts 26 hours.</p>
					<p>The axis of Uller is in the same plane as the orbit, so that at a certain time of the year the north pole is pointed directly at the sun, while at the opposite end of the orbit it points directly away. The result is highly exaggerated seasons. At the poles the temperature runs from 120° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">C</abbr> to a low of −80° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">C</abbr>. At the equator it remains not far from 10° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">C</abbr> all year round. Strong winds blow during the summer and winter, from the hot to the cold pole; few winds during the spring and fall. The appearance of the poles varies during the year from baked deserts to glaciers covered with solid <abbr epub:type="se:compound">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr>. Free water exists in the equatorial regions all year round.</p>

					<p>As seen from the north pole⁠—no sun is visible on January 1. On April 1, it bisects the horizon all day, swinging completely around. April 1 to July 1, it continues swinging around, gradually rising in the sky, the spiral converging to its center at the zenith, which it reaches July 1. From July 1 to October 1 the spiral starts again, spreading out from the center until on October 1 it bisects the horizon again. On October 1 night arrives to stay until April 1.</p>
					<p>At the equator, the sun is visible bisecting the southern horizon for all 26 hours of the day on January 1. From January 1 to April 1, the sun starts to dip below the horizon at night, to rise higher above it during the day. During all this time it rises and sets at the same hours, but rises in the southeast and sets in the southwest. At noon it is higher each day in the southern sky until April 1, when it rises due east, passes through the zenith and sets due west. From April 1 to July 1, its noon position drops down to the north, until on July 1, it is visible all day, bisected by the northern horizon.</p>

					<p>Calcium and chlorine are rarer than on earth, sodium is somewhat commoner. As a result of the shortage of calcium there is a higher ration of silicates to carbonates than exists on earth. The water is slightly alkaline and resembles a very dilute solution of sodium silicate (water glass). It would have a <abbr>pH</abbr> of 8.5 and tastes slightly soapy. Also, when it dries out it leaves a sticky, and then a glassy, crackly film. Rocks look fairly earthlike, but the absence or scarcity of anything like limestone is noticeable. Practically all the sedimentary rocks are of the sandstone type.</p>
					<p>All rivers are seasonal, running from the polar regions to the central seas in the spring only, or until the polar cap is completely dried out.</p>

					<p>As on Earth life arose in the primitive waters and with a carbon base, but because of the abundance of silicone, there was a strong tendency for the microscopic organisms to develop silicate exoskeletons, like diatoms. The present invertebrate animal life of the planet is of this type and is confined to the equatorial seas. They run from amoeba-like objects to things like crayfish, with silicate skeletons. Later, some species of them started taking silicone into their soft tissues, and eventually their carbon-chain compounds were converted to silicone type chains, from</p>
					<figure id="illustration-1">
						<img alt="Chemical diagram comparing carbon-chain molecules to a silicone type chain." src="../images/illustration-1.svg"/>
					</figure>
					<p class="continued">with organic radicals on the side links. These organisms were a transitional type, with silicone tissues and water body fluids, resembling the earthly amphibians, and are now practically extinct. There are a few species, something like segmented worms, still to be seen in the backwaters of the central seas.</p>
					<p>A further development occurred when the silicone chain animals began to get short-chain silicones into their circulatory systems, held in solution by <abbr epub:type="se:compound">OH</abbr> or <abbr epub:type="se:compound">NH<sub>2</sub></abbr> groups on the ends and branches of the chains. The proportion of these compounds gradually increased until the water was a minor and then a missing constituent. The larger mobile species were, then, practically anhydrous. Their blood consists of short-chain silicones, with quartz reinforcing for the soft parts and their armor, teeth, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, of pure amorphous quartz (opal). Most of these parts are of the milky variety, variously tinted with metallic impurities, as are the varieties of sapphires.</p>
					<p>These pure silicone animals, due to their practical indestructibility, annihilated all but the smaller of the carbon animals, and drove the compromise types into odd corners as relics. They developed into a fish-like animal with a very large swim-bladder to compensate for the rather higher density of the silicone tissues, and from these fish the land animals developed. Due to their high density and resulting high weight, they tend to be low on the ground, rather reptilian in look. Three pairs of legs are usual in order to distribute the heavy load. There is no sharp dividing line between the quartz armor and the silicone tissue. One merges into the other.</p>
					<p>The dominant pure silicone animals only could become mobile and venture far from the temperate equatorial regions of Uller, since they neither froze nor stiffened with cold, nor became incapacitated by heat. Note that all animal life is cold-blooded, with a negligible difference between body and ambient temperatures. Since the animals are silicones, they don’t get sluggish like cold snakes.</p>

					<p>The plants are of the carbon-metabolism, silicate-shell type, like the primitive animals. They spread out from the equator as far as they could go before the baking polar summers killed them. They have normal seasonal growth in the temperate zones and remain dormant and frozen in the winter. At the poles there is no vegetation, not because of the cold winter, but because of the hot summer. The winter winds frequently blow over dead trees and roll them as far as the equatorial seas. Other dead vegetation, because of the highly silicious water, always gets petrified unless it is eaten first. What with the quartz-speckled hides of the living vegetation and the solid quartz of the dead, a forest is spectacular.</p>
					<p>The silicone animals live on the plants. They chew them up, dehydrate them, and convert their silicious outer bark and carbonaceous interiors into silicones for themselves. When silicone tissue is metabolized, the carbon and hydrogen go to <abbr epub:type="se:compound">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> and <abbr epub:type="se:compound">H<sub>2</sub>O</abbr>, which are breathed out, while the silicone goes into <abbr epub:type="se:compound">SiO<sub>2</sub></abbr>, which is deposited as more teeth and armor. (Compare the terrestrial octopus, which makes armor-plating out of calcium urate instead of excreting urea or uric acid.) The animals can, of course, eat each other too, or make a meal of the small carbonaceous animals of the equatorial seas.</p>
					<p>Further note that the animals cannot digest plants when they are cold. They can eat them and store them, but the disposal of the solid water and <abbr epub:type="se:compound">CO<sub>2</sub></abbr> is too difficult a problem. When they warm up, the water in the plants melts and can be disposed of, and things are simpler.</p>

					<p>The planet named Niflheim is the fourth planet of Nu Puppis, right angle 6:36, declension −43:09; B8 type star, blue-white and hot, 148 light years distant from Earth, which will require a speed in excess of light to reach it.</p>
					<p>Niflheim is 462,000,000 miles from its primary, a little less than the distance of Jupiter from our sun. It thus does not receive too great a total amount of energy, but what it does receive is of high potential, a large fraction of it being in the ultraviolet and higher frequencies. (Watch out for really super-special sunburn, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, on unwarned personnel.)</p>
					<p>The gravity of Niflheim is approximately 1 <abbr>g</abbr>, the atmospheric pressure approximately 1 atmosphere, and the average ambient temperature about −60° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">C</abbr>; −76° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">F</abbr>.</p>

					<p>The oxidizer in the atmosphere is free fluorine (<abbr epub:type="se:compound">F<sub>2</sub></abbr>) in a rather low concentration, about 4 or 5 percent. With it appears a mad collection of gases. There are a few inert diluents, such as <abbr epub:type="se:compound">N<sub>2</sub></abbr> (nitrogen), argon, helium, neon, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, but the major fraction consists of <abbr epub:type="se:compound">CF<sub>4</sub></abbr> (carbon tetrafluoride), <abbr epub:type="se:compound">BF<sub>3</sub></abbr> (boron trifluoride), <abbr epub:type="se:compound">SiF<sub>4</sub></abbr> (silicon tetrafluoride), <abbr epub:type="se:compound">PF<sub>5</sub></abbr> (phosphorous pentafluoride), <abbr epub:type="se:compound">SF<sub>6</sub></abbr> (sulphur hexafluoride) and probably others. In other words, the fluorides of all the nonmetals that can form fluorides. The phosphorous pentafluoride rains out when the weather gets cold. There is also free oxygen, but no chlorine. That would be liquid except in very hot weather. It sometimes appears combined with fluorine in chlorine trifluoride. The atmosphere has a slight yellowish tinge.</p>

					<p>Above the metallic core of the planet, the lithosphere consists exclusively of fluorides of the metals. There are no oxides, sulfides, silicates or chlorides. There are small deposits of such things as bromine trifluoride, but these have no great importance. Since fluorides are weak mechanically, the terrain is flattish. Nothing tough like granite to build mountains out of. Since the fluoride ion is colorless, the color of the soil depends upon the predominant metal in the region. As most of the light metals also have colorless ions, the colored rocks are rather rare.</p>

					<p>They consist of liquid hydrofluoric acid (<abbr epub:type="se:compound">HF</abbr>). It melts at −83° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">C</abbr> and boils at 19.4° <abbr epub:type="se:temperature">C</abbr>. In it are dissolved varying quantities of metallic and nonmetallic fluorides, such as boron trifluoride, sodium fluoride, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> When the oceans and lakes freeze, they do so from the bottom up, so there is no layer of ice over free liquid.</p>

					<p>The plants function by photosynthesis, taking <abbr epub:type="se:compound">HF</abbr> as water from the soil, and carbon tetrafluoride as the equivalent of carbon dioxide from the air to produce chain compounds, such as:</p>
					<figure id="illustration-2">
						<img alt="Chemical diagram of a carbon-hydrogen-fluorine chain." src="../images/illustration-2.svg"/>
					</figure>
					<p class="continued">and at the same time liberating free fluorine. This reaction could only take place on a planet receiving lots of ultraviolet because so much energy is needed to break up carbon tetrafluoride and hydrofluoric acid. The plant catalyst (doubling for the magnesium in chlorophyll) is nickel. The plants are colored in various ways. They get their metals from the soil.</p>

					<p>Animals depend upon two main reactions for their energy, and for the construction of their harder tissues. The soft tissues are about the same as the plant molecules, but the hard tissues are produced by the reaction:</p>

						<img alt="Chemical diagram of a carbon-hydrogen-fluorine chain + flourine producing carbon-flourine chain + hydroflouric acid." src="../images/illustration-3.svg"/>

					<p>The blood catalyst metal is titanium, which results in colorless arterial blood and violet veinous, as the titanium flips back and forth between tri and tetravalent states.</p>

					<p>Water decomposes into oxygen and hydrofluoric acid. All organic matter (earth type) converts into oxygen, carbon tetrafluoride, hydrofluoric acid, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, with more or less speed. A rubber gas mask lasts about an hour. Glass first frosts and then disappears. Plastics act like rubber, only a little slower. The heavy metals, iron, nickel, copper, monel, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, stand up well, forming an insoluble coat of fluorides at first and then doing nothing else.</p>

					<p>Large natural crystals of fluorides, such as calcium difluoride, titanium tetrafluoride, zirconium tetrafluoride, are extremely useful in optical instruments of various forms. Uranium appears as uranium hexafluoride, all ready for the diffusion process. Compounds of such nonmetals as boron are obtainable from the atmosphere in high purity with very little trouble. All metallurgy must be electrical. There are considerable deposits of beryllium, and they occur in high concentration in its ores.</p>
